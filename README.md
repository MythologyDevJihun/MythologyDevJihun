Hello, Iâ€™m **Dev Jihun**, the leader and main developer of [MythologyTeams](https://mythologyteams.com).<br>
I have four years of experience as an app developer, but I am aiming to become a full-stack developer.<br>
To achieve this goal, I am actively studying and working on side projects to improve my skills.<br>
I enjoy tackling challenges that push me to think creatively and grow as a developer.
